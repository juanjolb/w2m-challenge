This is a repository that contains an Angular 17 project challenge for W2M, this project uses latest Angular features, like standalone components, new syntax and signals.

## Considerations

* Directive and interceptor points has been developed.
* This project uses json-server as a mockserver, it is mandatory to follow the setup guide.
* Tests and styles has not been implemented due to lack of time.
* Any question or additional comment, feel free to contact me (lbarcelo.juanjo@gmail.com).

     *npm i -g json-server@0.17.4*
