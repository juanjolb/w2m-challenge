# W2M Challenge by Juanjo Lozano 18/02/2024

This is a repository that contains an Angular 17 project challenge for W2M, this project uses latest Angular features, like standalone components, new syntax and signals.

## Considerations

* Directive and interceptor points has been developed
* This project uses json-server as a mockserver, the search funcionality is not complete because json-server does not accept nested queries
* Tests has not been because lack of time
* Any question or additional comment, feel free to contact me

## Setup

* ng serve --open
* npx json-server db.json
